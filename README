This is a simple script to download the latest 64 Bit Flash player (codenamed
"Square") from Adobe Labs [SQUARE] and install it locally in 
~/.mozilla/plugins.

It was inspired (see [ASKUBUNTU]) by the Flash-Aid Plugin [FLASHAID] which
works similarly but is more complex (and less secure since it pulls from plain
HTTP).

To run this script, you can execute

    wget -O- https://github.com/mss/getflashplugin64/raw/master/getflashplugin64.sh | /bin/bash

Since the preview release of Flash Square is rarely updated, I recommend to
use it together with Flashblock [FLASHBLOCK].

Be aware that you might experience sound glitches on some recent Linux
systems (see [MEMCPY]).
