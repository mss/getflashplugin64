This is a simple script to download the latest 64 Bit Flash player (codenamed
"Square") from Adobe Labs [1] and install it locally in ~/.mozilla/plugins.
It was inspired [2] by the Flash-Aid Plugin [3] which works similarly but is
more complex (and less ecure since it pulls from plain HTTP).

To run this script, you can execute

    wget -O- https://github.com/mss/getflashplugin64/raw/master/getflashplugin64.sh | /bin/bash

Since the preview release of Flash Square is rerely updated, I recommend to
use it together with Flashblock [3].
